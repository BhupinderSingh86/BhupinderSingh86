## ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Bhupinder Singh

I'm a software engineer based in Warwickshire with a passion for problem solving.

I am previously a prison officer working in the public sector industry for several years. I decided I wanted to pursue my new found love for coding so once I figured out my own solution to get into the tech world I left. As of November 2021, I stopped locking up prisoners and permanently locked myself into coding :computer:.

There are many reasons why I was inspired to make the leap into the tech sector but, the most aspiring is the desire in wanting to be a part of shaping our future for the generations to come. Furthermore, I love to split complex goals into smaller, more manageable ones and find problem solving interesting. Knowing that I have the capabilities and skills to be a part of solutions to user's problem gives me a sense of satisfaction. The fast paced, ever-changing environment, challenges and opportunities to grow and continuous learn excites me about the future that awaits me. In addition to technical skills, I am a great communicator and team player that thrives in working as part of a team.

I graduated from the [School of Code](https://www.schoolofcode.co.uk/) (a 16 week, full-time, fully-immersive programming bootcamp) in September 2022  and I am in search for my first tech career as a junior software engineer. Until then I continue to grow in my technical skill sets and learning new languages. I have begun learning JavaScript, React for frontend and backend with node.js, express and postSQL.

If Iâ€™m not sitting at my computer I'm travelling and exploring the outdoors with my computer right beside me for those AH HA coding moments! You can also find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bhupinder-singh-248284243/) or contact me via email on udaam13@gmail.com.
